      <div class="section-title">Intro & Motivation</div>

      <h2 id="intro">Elevator pitch</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I'm a full-stack developer with over six years of experience working on
        SaaS products. I usually own features end to end, from figuring out
        requirements to building the UI, wiring up the APIs, and supporting
        things in production.
      </div>

      <h2 id="why-this-role">Why are you interested in this role?</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        The chance to own full-stack features within systems that help detect
        threats and respond faster feels meaningful, and the mix of modern web
        tech and AI is exciting to me.
      </div>

      <h2 id="career-path">Why did you choose software development?</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I actually started out studying history and political science, but I
        realized I really enjoy building things, so I transitioned into web
        development through training and on-the-job experience.
      </div>

      <h2 id="last-role">Why did you leave your last role?</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I felt like I'd hit a plateau in my last role, and then my position was
        cut due to budget issues. Since then, I've been doing freelance
        consulting while looking for new full-stack opportunities.
      </div>

      <h2 id="consulting-work">What consulting work have you done?</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I've been helping a friend test out a business idea by giving
        architecture advice and quickly prototyping the product using React,
        TypeScript, Node, and SQL.
      </div>

      <div class="section-title">Technical Stack & Experience</div>

      <h2 id="stack">Describe your preferred stack</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I've built full-stack applications using React and Next.js on the
        frontend. On the backend, I use Node.js with Express.js and NestJS to
        build APIs, and I work with both SQL and NoSQL databases like MongoDB.
      </div>

      <h2 id="frontend-exp">Describe your frontend experience</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I've spent over six years building web apps with React, focusing on
        reusable components, modular architecture, and managing state cleanly. I
        also use Next.js for server-side rendering and routing, which which
        optimizes page load and SEO. I prioritize responsive, accessible
        interfaces and rely on component libraries and utility frameworks to
        keep designs consistent and easy to maintain.
      </div>

      <h2 id="backend-exp">Describe your backend experience</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I build backends with Node.js, using Express.js for quick APIs and
        NestJS for structured, modular services. I design REST APIs, handle
        auth, validation, and error handling, experience working with SQL and
        MongoDB, and deploying to AWS using CI/CD. I enjoy owning features
        end-to-end, balancing scalability and usability.
      </div>

      <h2 id="end-preference">
        Do you prefer frontend or backend development?
      </h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I enjoy full-stack work and don't really have a strong preference. I'm
        comfortable jumping between frontend and backend
      </div>

      <h2 id="have-you-used-technology">Have you used [technology] before?</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I haven't used Angular or Vue.js professionally yet, but I pick up new
        frameworks quickly. I'm aware that Vue is pretty similar to React, with
        Vuex for state and Nuxt.js like Next.js, so my experience with modular,
        component-based architectures transfers easily.
      </div>

      <div class="section-title">Cloud & Deployment</div>

      <h2 id="cloud-ci-cd">Cloud deployment & CI/CD experience</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I set up CI/CD pipelines to run builds and tests so issues are caught
        before staging or production. Locally, I use Docker to mirror
        production, including runtime, dependencies, and environment variables,
        which lets me safely test features and service interactions. For AWS, I
        deploy the frontend to S3, backend APIs on Lambda, and use managed
        databases. I rely on versioned releases and rollback strategies so that
        if anything goes wrong, I can quickly restore a previous working state,
        keeping deployments smooth and predictable.
      </div>

      <h2 id="git">Git experience</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I use Git daily for branching, PRs, and code reviews, keeping repos
        organized and commit history clean so the team stays aligned.
      </div>

      <div class="section-title">Databases & API Design</div>

      <h2 id="databases-exp">SQL, ORMs, and database experience</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I have solid experience with relational databases, designing schemas,
        indexes, and transactional workflows. I use ORMs like Prisma to keep
        things consistent and maintainable, but I'm not dependent on them
        because I'm comfortable building, executing, and debugging raw SQL
        queries.
      </div>

      <h2 id="api-design">How do you design APIs?</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I design APIs following REST principles, with clear endpoints, proper
        HTTP verbs, and meaningful status codes. I keep responses consistent and
        predictable so the front end can use them easily and safely. I've
        implemented JWT authentication and role-based access control, and I
        build in pagination, filtering, and caching from the start to optimize
        performance.
      </div>

      <div class="section-title">UX/UI & Frontend Practices</div>

      <h2 id="ux-ui">UX/UI mindset and examples</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I focus on UI and UX with a user-first mindset, building interfaces that
        are intuitive, accessible, and easy to navigate. I make sure apps are
        responsive and optimized for different mobile devices, and I provide
        clear feedback during loading or other interactions, using semantic HTML
        and ARIA roles to support accessibility. I also use modular component
        libraries to keep designs consistent and scalable.
      </div>

      <div class="section-title">Testing & Reliability</div>

      <h2 id="testing">Testing strategies</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I test at multiple levels to make sure everything works reliably. I
        write unit tests with Jest for components and logic, run integration
        tests to verify frontend-backend interactions, and use Postman to
        validate APIs in real-world scenarios. I'm also comfortable debugging
        raw SQL queries when needed.
      </div>

      <h2 id="debugging-issues">Debugging production issues</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I've debugged production issues on both frontend and backend. When a bug
        doesn't reproduce locally, I check logs, compare staging and production
        environments, and sometimes spin up a test environment to isolate the
        problem. I'm used to handling things like misconfigured environment
        variables, unexpected API errors, or database queries that behave
        differently in production.
      </div>

      <div class="section-title">Project Leadership & Problem Solving</div>

      <h2 id="problem-solving-example">
        Complex Full Stack Project Leadership
      </h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        At Civix, I owned a document submission and approval feature for the New
        Jersey Office of Emergency Management, supporting FEMA compliance.
        Agencies submitted complex documents with strict validation and approval
        rules. I built a React frontend for submissions and tracking, NestJS for
        the backend API which make requests to SQL logic enforcing the rules.
        Working closely with QA and support, I handled edge cases, refined
        workflows and incorporated client feedack.
      </div>

      <h2 id="prioritize-work">
        How do you prioritize work when multiple tasks compete?
      </h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I focus on urgency, weigh the impact of dependencies, and communicate
        progress proactively to keep the team aligned.
      </div>

      <div class="section-title">Teamwork & Collaboration</div>

      <h2 id="teamwork">How do you work in a team?</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I work closely with my team through code reviews, architecture
        discussions, and pair programming. I give and take feedback and support
        teammates with guidance when it's helpful.
      </div>

      <h2 id="conflict">Handling disagreements</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        When disagreements come up, I listen first, explain my reasoning
        clearly, and focus on solutions so discussions stay productive.
      </div>

      <h2 id="professional-development">
        What does professional development mean to you?
      </h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I focus on tackling challenges that push me technically, learning
        through building, and picking up new skills from others through
        mentorship, code reviews, and architecture discussions.
      </div>

      <div class="section-title">AI & Productivity Tools</div>

      <h2 id="ai-workflow">How do you use AI in your workflow?</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I use AI to speed up my workflow and keep quality high without replacing
        my judgment. In my Airbnb Tracker project, for example, I follow a
        structured AI workflow with Cursor: start with a project brief, generate
        a technical plan, build features step by step, and then run a code
        review in a fresh AI context to catch errors and edge cases. This helps
        me stay efficient, consistent, and focused on building complex features.
      </div>

      <h2 id="clever-ai-usage">Clever AI Usage / Projects</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I built Airbnb Tracker, a full-stack app that tracks changes in Airbnb
        listings over time to help hosts spot patterns and improve their
        listings based on competitor behavior. It uses a Next.js frontend,
        NestJS API, and PostgreSQL with Prisma. I also leverage AI tools to
        speed up debugging and optimization while keeping features reliable and
        maintainable.
      </div>

      <div class="section-title">Interview Process & Closing</div>

      <h2 id="interviewer-questions">Questions to ask the Interviewer</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Can you describe what a typical day or week looks like in this role?
