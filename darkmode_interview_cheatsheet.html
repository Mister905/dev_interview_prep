    <div class="section-title">Intro & Motivation</div>

    <h2 id="intro">Elevator pitch</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I’m a full-stack engineer with six years of experience building SaaS products end to end. I take ownership from
      requirements and design through implementation and production, which lets me connect technical architecture
      directly to real user impact.
    </div>

    <h2 id="why-this-role">Why are you interested in this role?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">

    </div>

    <h2 id="next-role">What are you looking for in your next role?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I’m looking for a role where I can continue to develop professionally with meaningful projects and really take
      ownership of my work. I
      also value being part of a team that works hard but still makes time to collaborate and have a good time together.
    </div>

    <h2 id="professional-development">
      What does professional development mean to you?
    </h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I grow most by working on problems that push my technical boundaries and force me to learn through real-world
      implementation. I also see collaboration as a core part of development. Architecture discussions and code reviews
      are where I pick up new perspectives and help keep the team’s standards high.
    </div>

    <h2 id="career-path">Why did you choose software development?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I enjoyed the analytical side of my studies, but I realized I was more excited by actually building things. I
      taught myself to code, moved into a development role, and found that my research background helps a lot when I’m
      digging into complex requirements.
    </div>

    <h2 id="last-role">Why did you leave your last role?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I had reached a point where I was ready for a new challenge, and my role was later impacted by budget-related
      changes. Since then, I’ve been doing some freelance consulting while looking for my next full-time role.
    </div>

    <h2 id="consulting-work">What consulting work have you done?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I’m helping a friend validate a business idea by acting as a technical consultant. I’m responsible for the
      architecture and for building a prototype using React, TypeScript, and Node. The product tracks how Airbnb
      listings change over time by capturing daily snapshots of things like amenities and photos, keeping a full history
      so users can compare any two dates. I’ve focused on making the interface clean and responsive so the data is easy
      to explore.

      I’m also helping a friend who is a teacher build a trivia app based on historical Jeopardy data, giving fans a fun
      way to play and sharpen their knowledge.
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Technical Stack & Experience</div>

    <h2 id="stack">Describe your preferred stack</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I’m most productive with React and Next.js on the frontend. For the backend, I usually go with Node, using either
      Express or NestJS depending on how much structure the project needs. I’m also comfortable jumping between SQL and
      NoSQL databases.
    </div>

    <h2 id="frontend-exp">Describe your frontend experience</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      On the frontend, I mainly work with React and Next.js, with a focus on reusable components and clean state
      management. I typically choose Next.js for production because it handles routing and image optimization out of the
      box, but I’ll use a standard React setup for simpler internal tools where SEO is not a concern.

      I also prioritize accessibility and responsiveness using Tailwind and Shadcn. I like that stack because it avoids
      the overhead of a large component library. Since Shadcn components live directly in the codebase, I fully own and
      customize them, which makes layout changes easier and keeps the codebase lean.
    </div>

    <h2 id="backend-exp">Describe your backend experience</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I build backends primarily with Node.js, using Express for lighter APIs and NestJS when I need a more structured
      and modular architecture. I’ve also worked with Flask, which has given me perspective on how different ecosystems
      approach routing and middleware. Regardless of the framework, my focus is on building robust REST APIs, handling
      authentication, and keeping data validation consistent throughout the system.
    </div>

    <h2 id="end-preference">
      Do you prefer frontend or backend development?
    </h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I enjoy full-stack work because I like seeing how the architecture on both sides connects. I’m comfortable moving
      between frontend and backend and especially enjoy the problem solving that happens at the intersection. For me,
      it’s less about choosing a favorite layer and more about owning a feature from the database through to the UI.
    </div>

    <h2 id="have-you-used-technology">Have you used [technology] before?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I haven't used [technology] professionally yet, but I’m a fast learner when it comes to new stacks. Since I have a
      strong grasp of the underlying patterns in my current stack, I’ve found that I can usually translate those
      concepts to new frameworks and get up to speed very quickly.
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">State Management / Redux</div>

    <h2 id="redux-vs-local-state">When should you use Redux vs local React state?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I use Redux for global state that multiple components need, like auth, theme, or app-wide preferences. For state
      that lives in a single component, I stick with useState or useReducer to keep things simple and avoid unnecessary
      re-renders. I use Redux Toolkit to reduce boilerplate and follow standard patterns.
    </div>

    <h2 id="redux-structure-large-apps">What are best practices for structuring Redux in large apps?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      In large apps, I structure Redux by splitting the store into feature slices, which keeps each domain manageable
      and easier to maintain, while the root reducer stays simple. I keep side-effects out of reducers and handle async
      logic separately. I use memoized selectors to prevent unnecessary re-renders and only store state that truly needs
      to be shared, deriving everything else in selectors to keep the store clean.
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">API Design & System Architecture</div>

    <h2 id="api-design">How do you design APIs?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I follow RESTful principles with clear, resource-based naming and meaningful status codes so APIs are predictable
      and easy to use. For security, I use JWT authentication with roles embedded in the token, letting the API handle
      authorization without extra database lookups. I also focus on performance with pagination, filtering, and caching
      from the start. Consistent response structures ensure the frontend always knows what to expect, keeping
      development fast and predictable.
    </div>

    <h2 id="structure-large-scale-react">How do you structure large-scale React applications?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I organize code by feature, so each domain owns its components, hooks, and types, letting teams work in parallel
      and reducing the chance of conflicts. This also makes the codebase easier to navigate and scale as the app grows.
    </div>

    <h2 id="api-scalability-maintainability">How do you design APIs for scalability and maintainability?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I design APIs with clear resource boundaries, consistent response shapes, and built-in features like pagination
      and filtering so the frontend can use them predictably and scale easily. I structure the backend modularly, add
      logging and metrics early, and enforce conventions and shared types to keep the system maintainable as it grows.
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Databases</div>

    <h2 id="databases-exp">SQL, ORMs, and database experience</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I have strong experience with relational databases, designing schemas, managing indexes, and handling
      transactions. I use ORMs like Prisma for type safety and speed but can write raw SQL when needed for complex
      queries or optimizations. I typically use SQL for structured, integrity-critical data and NoSQL for flexible
      schemas or fast iteration.
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Scalability & Performance</div>

    <h2 id="cloud-ci-cd">Cloud deployment & CI/CD experience</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I use Docker to standardize my local environment once the project structure is in place. After defining the
      frontend and backend directories, I containerize them so the team is aligned on the same versions and
      configurations from the start.

      For deployment, I typically use AWS, with S3 for the frontend and Lambda for the backend, and I set up CI/CD
      pipelines to automate testing and versioned releases. I focus on predictability and always plan for rollbacks so a
      known good state can be restored quickly if issues arise.
    </div>

    <h2 id="git">Git experience</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I use Git daily following a feature-branch workflow. I maintain a clean, linear history by squashing incremental
      updates into meaningful commits and rebasing to keep my branch current. This helps avoid messy merge commits and
      makes the project history easier to audit.

      I treat pull requests as more than just code checks. They are opportunities for peer review and knowledge sharing.
      By using clear naming conventions and descriptive PRs, I make sure the team understands the reasoning behind each
      change, which makes it easier for others to work in the codebase later.
    </div>

    <h2 id="optimize-react-large-datasets">How do you optimize React for large datasets?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I optimize React for large datasets by rendering only what’s visible and avoiding storing huge lists in global
      state. I fetch or stream data in chunks, and I memoize components so only what actually changes re-renders. This
      keeps the UI fast and responsive even with tens of thousands of items.
    </div>

    <h2 id="api-performance-heavy-load">How do you handle API performance under heavy load?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I handle API performance under heavy load by building in pagination, caching, and rate limiting, which controls
      how many requests a client can make in a given time to protect the system. On the backend, I optimize queries, use
      batching or joins to avoid repeated lookups, and handle heavy operations asynchronously. I monitor performance
      with logging and metrics so I can spot bottlenecks, add indexes or caching where needed, and prevent slowdowns
      before they affect users.
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">UX/UI & Frontend Practices</div>

    <h2 id="ux-ui">UX/UI mindset and examples</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I focus on UI and UX with a user-first mindset, building interfaces that
      are intuitive, accessible, and easy to navigate. I make sure apps are
      responsive and optimized for different mobile devices, and I provide
      clear feedback during loading or other interactions, using semantic HTML
      and ARIA roles to support accessibility. I also use modular component
      libraries to keep designs consistent and scalable.
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Testing, Observability & Reliability</div>

    <h2 id="testing">Testing strategies</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I follow a multi-layered testing strategy using Jest for unit tests and integration tests to verify service
      interactions. I treat API validation as a priority, using Postman to simulate real-world scenarios.

      Beyond automated suites, I'm highly comfortable with manual data debugging when troubleshooting production edge
      cases. I use raw SQL to investigate state-dependent issues, ensuring I can identify the root cause, reproduce it
      in a safe environment, and ultimately lock in a fix with a new regression test.
    </div>

    <h2 id="debugging-issues">Debugging production issues</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I tackle production issues by starting with logs and monitoring to spot patterns missing in development. I isolate
      the failing component, reproduce the issue in a safe environment, and fix the root cause. I also add durable
      improvements like tests or validation to prevent the same problem from recurring.
    </div>

    <h2 id="monitor-production-frontend">How do you monitor production frontend apps?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I monitor production frontend apps using error tracking and real user monitoring to catch issues users actually
      experience. I track key performance metrics and set up alerts for regressions. I also focus on critical user
      flows, monitoring their success and speed so we can quickly trace and fix any problems that slip past staging.
    </div>

    <h2 id="testing-complex-react">What testing strategies do you use for complex React applications?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I use a layered testing approach. Unit tests cover pure logic and reusable functions, while component tests focus
      on user-facing behavior. I prioritize critical paths and edge cases to keep tests fast and meaningful. For
      integration, I test key flows that cross components or API boundaries, focusing on the areas that would have the
      biggest impact if they broke.

      Complex Full Stack Project Leadership
    </h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      At Civix, I led the full-stack development of a document submission and approval system for the NJ Office of
      Emergency Management. The biggest challenge was FEMA compliance, requiring strict data validation and a
      multi-stage approval workflow. I built the frontend in React, backend in NestJS, and designed the SQL schema to
      enforce compliance at the data level. Working closely with QA and stakeholders, I turned a rigid regulatory
      process into an intuitive user experience, handling everything from architecture to production support.

    <h2 id="prioritize-work">
      How do you prioritize work when multiple tasks compete?
    </h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      When tasks compete, I prioritize them by weighing their importance to the business against how quickly they need
      to be done. I specifically look for tasks that are holding up other team members and handle those first so the
      whole team can keep moving.

      I also believe in clear, early communication. If a major bug forces me to pause my current work, I let my manager
      and stakeholders know right away. This allows us to adjust the timeline together and ensures we stay focused on
      the most important work without any surprises.
    </div>

    <h2 id="approach-ambiguous-problems">How do you approach unclear requirements or ambiguous problems?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I start by clarifying the goal and the constraints. I ask what success looks like, who is affected, and what
      we can and cannot change. I then break the problem into smaller pieces and tackle the riskiest or most
      uncertain parts first, often with a spike or a small prototype so we learn quickly.

      I document assumptions and share them with product and stakeholders so we stay aligned. If the requirements
      keep changing, I focus on a minimal solution that delivers value and is easy to extend, rather than building
      for every possible future. I have used this approach on projects where the product was still being defined
      and we had to ship while the scope evolved.
    </div>

    <h2 id="measure-feature-success">How do you measure the success of your features or technical decisions?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I tie success to outcomes that matter to the business and the user. For a feature, that might be adoption,
      completion rate, or time on task. For a technical change, it might be reduced latency, fewer bugs, or faster
      deploys. I define these up front when possible so we know what we are optimizing for.

      I use the data we already have, like analytics, error rates, and performance metrics, and I avoid adding
      instrumentation everywhere. When we shipped a refactor of a critical flow, we tracked error rate and
      load time before and after and used that to confirm the change was safe and to justify future investments.
    </div>

    <h2 id="teamwork">How do you work in a team?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I thrive in a collaborative environment where code reviews and architecture discussions are used to share
      knowledge and keep our standards consistent. I’m a big fan of pair programming for tackling complex problems, and
      I make it a priority to be available whenever a teammate needs a second pair of eyes.

      I also view feedback as a two-way street. I try to provide constructive suggestions that help the code improve,
      while staying open to different perspectives on my own work. Ultimately, I want to be the reliable partner who
      helps the team stay productive and builds a better product together.
    </div>

    <h2 id="conflict">Handling disagreements</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      When I encounter a technical disagreement, I start by listening to the other perspective to make sure I fully
      understand their concerns. I then explain my own reasoning, focusing on the trade-offs and how each choice affects
      the project goals.

      By keeping the conversation centered on the problem rather than the person, we can stay focused on the most
      effective solution. My priority is always to reach a consensus that keeps the team moving forward without
      compromising on quality or maintainability.
    </div>

    <h2 id="mentor-junior-engineers">How do you mentor junior engineers?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I give junior engineers ownership of small, clear tasks so they can learn by doing. I pair on tricky parts, do
      code reviews that explain the why, and encourage them to propose solutions first. I share system and business
      context so they can make better decisions, helping them grow quickly in a safe environment.
    </div>

    <h2 id="influence-architecture-standards">How do you influence architecture and team standards?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I lead by example and by writing things down. I document decisions and trade-offs in ADRs or design docs so
      the team has a shared reference. I propose standards when I see repeated pain, and I get buy-in by
      showing the impact with a small pilot or proof of concept before we roll it out broadly.

      I also use code reviews and architecture discussions to align on patterns. I do not insist on my way;
      I frame options and trade-offs so the team can choose together. When we introduced a new testing
      strategy, I ran a short workshop and left runbooks and examples so everyone could adopt it over time.
    </div>

    <h2 id="resolve-team-conflicts">How do you resolve conflicts in the team?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I focus on the problem, not the person. I listen to each perspective and make sure everyone feels heard.
      I then help the team compare options against our goals and constraints so we can choose a path that
      everyone can support, even if it is not everyone's first choice.

      When there is a technical disagreement, I suggest we prototype or spike both approaches when it is
      feasible so we can decide on data rather than opinion. If we are stuck, I am willing to make a call and
      own it, and we document the decision and revisit it later if needed.

    <div class="section-title">Past Failures & Technical Weaknesses</div>

    <h2 id="dealing-with-failure">Dealing with failure</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I once deployed a database migration that caused downtime. I took full ownership and fixed it, then updated our
      process to require staging tests with production-sized data and added granular monitoring. I learned that a fix
      isn’t done until the system is improved to prevent it from happening again.
    </div>

    <h2 id="addressing-technical-weakness">Addressing technical weakness</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      Early in my career, I often over-engineered solutions for future needs. Now I focus more on simple, maintainable
      code that solves the current problem. This keeps things clean and makes it easier to adapt when new requirements
      actually come up.
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">AI & Productivity Tools</div>

    <h2 id="ai-workflow">How do you use AI in your workflow?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I use AI to speed up my workflow without replacing my judgment. I start with a clear brief, let the AI help plan
      and generate code, then review everything carefully. This keeps work consistent and lets me focus on complex
      architectural challenges.
    </div>

    <h2 id="communicate-tradeoffs-product-design">How do you communicate technical trade-offs to product and design
      teams?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I focus on outcomes and trade-offs, not implementation details. I explain options clearly, use simple language or
      sketches, and make decisions collaboratively. Being transparent about risks and priorities builds trust and avoids
      surprises.
    </div>

    <h2 id="drive-technical-vision">How do you drive technical vision without formal authority?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I build credibility by shipping and helping others succeed. I propose ideas with clear problems, options, and a
      recommended path, backed by data or a quick proof of concept. I start pilots or docs without waiting for
      permission and break vision into actionable steps the team can take now. This approach has led to tangible wins,
      like improving frontend performance through a targeted spike and rollout.
