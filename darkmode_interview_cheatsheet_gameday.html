      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="why-this-role">Why this role?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      <ul>
        <li>Develop modern full-stack applications while leveraging my experience to simplify onboarding and make
          meaningful contributions from the start</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

          clear communication, accountability, and honest feedback</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="career-path">Why did you choose software development?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      <ul>
        <li>I enjoy turning complex problems into real, tangible solutions, and software gives me more chances to do
          that than history or political science. That said, my analytical and research background really helps me break
          down requirements and create clear, maintainable technical documentation</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="last-role">Why did you leave your last role?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      <ul>
        <li>I was ready for a new challenge, but the role was affected by budget changes. Since then, I've been doing
          freelance consulting while looking for the right full-time opportunity</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="consulting-work">What consulting work have you done?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      <ul>
        <li>Built a dashboard for a short-term rental business to track competitors</li>

    <div class="block quote">
      <ul>
        <li>AI to speed up work without replacing my experience and judgment</li>
        <li>Sequential workflow: codify business logic → break project into features → plan → implement → code review in
          isolated agent context (focused feedback) → fix issues</li>
        <li>Keeps code focused, bugs isolated, reviews clear, and progress easy to track</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="see-yourself">Where do you see yourself?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">

        <li>Value mentorship because it shaped my own growth</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="problem-solving-example">Complex Full Stack Project Leadership</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      <ul>
        <li>Civix: Built claims document submission and approval for NJ Office of Emergency Management within FEMA grant
          management software</li>
        <li>Challenge: Enforced strict validation across multi-step approval workflows</li>
        <li>Stack: React front end, NestJS API, SQL schema to ensure compliance</li>
        <li>Collaboration: Partnered with QA and stakeholders to create an intuitive UX despite rigid regulatory
          constraints</li>
        <li>Prioritization: Focused first on implementing critical regulatory validations that could block QA from
          testing downstream steps, ensuring compliance and allowing the team to continue working efficiently. After the
          essential checks were in place, I addressed remaining workflow steps and UI enhancements to maintain speed,
          usability, and overall team productivity.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      <ul>
        <li>Use logs and monitoring to see patterns and locate errors.</li>
        <li>Trace the issue to the right layer (frontend, backend, or database).</li>
        <li>Reproduce in a safe environment, fix the root cause, and add validation or tests to prevent recurrence.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="deployment-cicd">Deployment Strategy and CI/CD Approach</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      <p>I use Docker and Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) to standardize environments and deliver
        safe, repeatable releases. The frontend and backend are deployed independently to enable faster updates, simpler
        maintenance, and independent scaling.</p>
      <p>On pushes to the main branch, GitHub Actions runs tests and builds deployment artifacts. The backend is
        packaged
        as a Docker image, pushed to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and deployed to Amazon Elastic Container
        Service (ECS) using rolling deployments. The frontend is built as a static site, uploaded to Amazon Simple
        Storage Service (S3), and served through Amazon CloudFront, with cache invalidation to ensure users receive the
        latest version.</p>
      <p>
        Configuration is managed via environment variables and validated in staging before production. Rollbacks are
        explicit and predictable, using a previous ECS task definition or container image for the backend and versioned
        S3 assets for the frontend. This approach keeps deployments reliable while minimizing operational risk.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="teamwork">Teamwork</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      <ul>
        <li>Enjoy collaborating on code reviews, pair programming, and architecture discussions</li>
        <li>Give constructive feedback generously and receive it graciously; resolve disagreements by focusing on
          solutions, not personalities</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="prioritization">Prioritization</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      <ul>
        <li>Evaluate competing priorities by their business value and time-sensitivity</li>
        <li>Focus on blocking tasks first to keep teammates moving forward</li>
        <li>Example: At Civix, I balanced enforcing strict regulatory validations with keeping QA able to test
          subsequent workflow steps. I implemented critical validations first to ensure compliance while allowing the
          team to continue testing and working efficiently, then addressed UI enhancements and workflow improvements.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="ambiguity">Ambiguity</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      <ul>
        <li>Clarify goals and constraints, break work into smaller parts, document assumptions, and align proactively
          with stakeholders</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="stakeholders">Communicating with stakeholders/clients</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      <ul>
        <li>Focus on outcomes and trade-offs, not implementation</li>
        <li>Transparent about risks and willing to provide diplomatic pushback to flawed assumptions</li>
        <li>Using simple language on video calls, screen recordings or sketches for visual references</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="chess">How would you design a Chess game app?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      <ul>
        <li>I'd design real-time chess using a server-authoritative model where the server is the single source of
          truth. Clients never update game state directly, they only send move intents like from-square and to-square
        </li>
        <li>Each move is validated on the server against the current game state. If it's legal and it's the player's
          turn, the server updates and persists the state, then immediately pushes the result to both players over a
          persistent connection like WebSockets. That avoids polling and keeps both clients perfectly in sync</li>
        <li>For security, authentication identifies the player, but all authorization and rule enforcement happens
          server-side. Even if someone bypasses the frontend and sends malicious requests, the server still verifies
          turn order, player ownership, and move legality before accepting anything.</li>
        <li>The key idea is that the client is just a renderer, and the server validates, owns, and broadcasts the
          truth.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="twitter">How would you design Twitter?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      <ul>
        <li>I'd start by identifying core features: user accounts, posting short messages, following users, and viewing a feed. Each feature maps to conceptual data models like User, Post, and Follow.</li>
        <li>Posting and feed generation would be handled server-side. When a user posts, the server writes to the database and updates cached feeds. Reading a feed pulls precomputed or cached data to ensure fast responses.</li>
        <li>Scaling challenges include handling high read-to-write ratios and generating feeds efficiently. I'd use caching for frequently accessed data, separate read-heavy and write-heavy workloads, and precompute feeds where possible.</li>
        <li>Deployment would involve a load balancer distributing requests across multiple identical application servers. Horizontal scaling allows the system to handle increased traffic by adding more servers.</li>
        <li>The key principle: the server is authoritative. It owns the data, enforces rules, and responds to clients. Clients render content and make requests but never directly modify state.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="interviewer-questions">Questions to ask the Interviewer</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      <ul>
        <li>What are the team's most important projects or priorities right now?</li>
        <li>What are the next steps in the interview process?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="closing">Closing line</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      <ul>
        <li>Thanks for your time today. I'd be happy to continue the process and talk more.</li>
