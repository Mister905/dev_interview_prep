    <div class="section-title">1. Core</div>

    <h2 id="intro">Elevator pitch</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I’m a full-stack developer with 6+ years of experience, primarily using React, TypeScript, Node, and SQL. I take
      features end to end, designing databases, building backend APIs, implementing UI, and handling deployment, while
      collaborating closely with product managers, QA, and external partners.
    </div>

    <h2 id="why-this-role">Why are you interested in this role?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I’m interested in this role because it lets me build modern full-stack apps and apply my experience in
      development, testing, and collaboration to contribute effectively.
    </div>

    <h2 id="next-role">What are you looking for in your next role?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I'm looking for a role where I can take real ownership of meaningful work, continue growing technically, and work
      with a team that values healthy collaboration. By that I mean clear communication, shared accountability,
      constructive feedback, and an environment where people support each other while holding high standards.
    </div>

    <h2 id="career-path">Why did you choose software development?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I chose software development because I enjoy building tangible solutions to complex problems. I taught myself to
      code, moved into a development role, and found that my analytical and research background translates well to
      breaking down requirements and delivering practical software.
    </div>

    <h2 id="last-role">Why did you leave your last role?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I was ready for a new challenge, and the role was later impacted by budget-related changes. Since then, I've been
      doing freelance consulting while searching for the right full-time opportunity.
    </div>

    <h2 id="consulting-work">What consulting work have you done?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I'm acting as a technical consultant on a prototype called Airbnb Tracker, a full-stack web app that captures
      daily snapshots of Airbnb listings to preserve their history and enable side-by-side comparison. I own the
      architecture and implementation end to end, using React and TypeScript on the frontend and NestJS with PostgreSQL
      on the backend. My focus is on delivering a clean, responsive interface that makes complex data easy to explore,
      while ensuring the system handles versioning, scraping, and data normalization reliably.
    </div>

    <h2 id="see-yourself">Where do you see yourself?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I see myself tackling increasingly complex projects, helping the team solve challenging problems, and contributing
      where I can make the biggest impact. When I'm genuinely engaged with the work and team, I focus on providing value
      wherever it's needed.
    </div>

    <h2 id="relocate">Are you willing to relocate to [city]?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      At this stage, I'm primarily focused on remote roles, where I've consistently delivered strong results. That said,
      I'm open to discussing expectations and understanding how important on-site presence is to success in this role.

      <p>If they say hybrid is important:</p>

      <p>That makes sense. Before committing to anything, I'd want to understand how often on-site presence is actually
        required and what problems it's intended to solve. In my experience, many of those needs can be handled
        effectively with strong communication and clear processes.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="stack">Describe your preferred stack</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I'm most productive with React and Next.js on the frontend. On the backend, I use Node with Express or NestJS,
      depending on the project's complexity. I'm comfortable working with both SQL and NoSQL databases and choosing the
      right tool for the job.
    </div>

    <h2 id="frontend-exp">Describe your frontend experience</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I build frontends mainly with React and Next.js, focusing on reusable components and well-structured state
      management. I use React for interactive UIs and Next.js when SEO, performance, or routing are priorities. I
      prioritize accessibility and responsive design with Tailwind and Shadcn, keeping the codebase lean and fully
      customizable.
    </div>

    <h2 id="backend-exp">Describe your backend experience</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I build backends mainly with Node.js, using Express for lightweight APIs and NestJS for structured, modular
      systems. I've also worked with Flask, which gave me perspective on different approaches to routing and middleware.
      My focus is on robust REST APIs, consistent data validation, and secure authentication.
    </div>

    <h2 id="end-preference">Do you prefer frontend or backend development?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I enjoy full-stack work because I like seeing how frontend and backend connect. I'm comfortable switching between
      layers and especially enjoy solving problems at the intersection. For me, it's about owning a feature from
      database to UI rather than picking a favorite layer.
    </div>

    <h2 id="have-you-used-technology">Have you used [technology] before?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I haven't used [technology] professionally, but I learn new stacks quickly. My experience with similar patterns
      lets me get up to speed fast.
    </div>

    <h2 id="cloud-ci-cd">Cloud deployment &amp; CI/CD experience</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I standardize environments with Docker and use CI/CD to build, test, and deploy reliably. I set up a
      production-safe GitHub Actions pipeline: on push to main, the backend runs tests, builds a Docker image, pushes to
      ECR, and triggers an ECS rolling deployment, while the frontend builds a static export, syncs to S3, and
      invalidates CloudFront. Rollback is explicit, using the previous ECS task or image for the backend and versioned
      S3 files for the frontend. After restoring stability, I fix the issue and deploy forward, keeping releases safe
      and predictable.
    </div>

    <h2 id="problem-solving-example">Complex Full Stack Project Leadership</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I led full-stack development for Civix, which builds software to simplify managing FEMA grants. I built a document
      submission and approval system for the NJ Office of Emergency Management. The biggest challenge was FEMA
      compliance, with strict data validation and a multi-stage approval workflow. I used React for the frontend, NestJS
      for the backend, and designed the SQL schema to enforce compliance. Working with QA and stakeholders, I turned a
      rigid regulatory process into an intuitive user experience and managed everything from architecture to production
      support.
    </div>

    <h2 id="ai-workflow">How do you use AI in your workflow?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I use AI to speed up my workflow without replacing my judgment. I follow a sequential prompt workflow: first I
      create a brief to set context, then plan a feature, implement that plan, run a code review in a clean context, and
      finally fix issues identified. This keeps work consistent, removes bias, and lets me focus on complex
      architectural challenges.
    </div>

    <h2 id="interviewer-questions">Questions to ask the Interviewer</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      <ul>
        <li>Can you describe what a typical day or week looks like in this role?</li>
        <li>What are the most important projects or priorities the team is focusing on right now?</li>
        <li>How is the team structured, and who would I work most closely with?</li>
        <li>What are the next steps in the interview process?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="closing">Closing line</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      Thanks for your time today. I'd be happy to continue the process and talk more.
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">2. Technical Stack &amp; Core Experience</div>


    <h2 id="redux-vs-local-state">When should you use Redux vs local React state?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I use Redux for global state shared across the app, such as authentication, while keeping local component state
      separate to avoid unnecessary re-renders. Redux helps reduce boilerplate, enforce consistent patterns, and keep
      global state predictable and maintainable. For example, it lets you define state and update logic in one place and
      safely manage changes across the app.
    </div>

    <h2 id="redux-structure-large-apps">What are best practices for structuring Redux in large apps?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      In large apps, I split the Redux store into feature slices so each domain is manageable and easier to maintain,
      while keeping the root reducer simple. I keep reducers pure and handle async logic—like API calls or background
      tasks—using middleware such as Redux Thunk or Redux Toolkit’s createAsyncThunk. I avoid storing redundant or
      computed data in the store, calculating derived values on the fly when needed. This keeps the store clean,
      predictable, and easier to reason about.
    </div>


    <h2 id="api-design">How do you design APIs?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I design APIs following RESTful principles with clear, resource-based naming and meaningful status codes to keep
      them predictable and easy to use. I secure endpoints using JWTs with embedded roles, so authorization is handled
      efficiently. I also build in performance features like pagination, filtering, and caching from the start, and keep
      response structures consistent so the frontend always knows what to expect.
    </div>

    <h2 id="structure-large-scale-react">How do you structure large-scale React applications?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I structure large React apps by feature, keeping each domain's components, hooks, and types together. This makes
      the codebase easier to navigate, scale, and allows teams to work in parallel.
    </div>

    <h2 id="api-scalability-maintainability">How do you design APIs for scalability and maintainability?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I design APIs so each endpoint manages a single resource, like /users or /listings, and always returns the same
      fields with consistent types, letting clients rely on a predictable response structure. I include pagination and
      filtering to make large datasets easy to query. On the backend, I organize code into feature modules with defined
      responsibilities, use shared types and interfaces across frontend and backend, and enforce input validation and
      error handling to keep the system reliable and maintainable as it grows.
    </div>

    <h2 id="databases-exp">SQL, ORMs, and database experience</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I have solid experience with relational databases, including schema design, indexing, and transactions. I use ORMs
      like Prisma, which generates TypeScript types from the database schema, so queries, results, and relationships are
      all type-checked at compile time. This reduces runtime errors and speeds up development. Prisma also handles
      migrations and auto-generates queries, keeping the schema consistent. I write raw SQL when queries require
      fine-tuned performance or complexity. I choose SQL for structured, integrity-critical data and NoSQL when I need
      flexible schemas or faster iteration.
    </div>

    <h2 id="ux-ui">UX/UI mindset and examples</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I focus on building intuitive, accessible interfaces that users can navigate easily. I ensure apps are responsive
      across devices and provide clear feedback during interactions, using semantic HTML, ARIA roles, and Tailwind for
      styling. I also use modular component libraries like Shadcn to keep designs consistent and scalable.
    </div>

    <h2 id="server-vs-client">Server vs client responsibilities</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I push work to the server when it improves UX or security: data fetching so the client gets HTML with content,
      auth checks, and heavy computation. The client owns interactivity, client-only state, and anything that depends on
      browser APIs. In Next.js I use Server Components by default and opt into client components only where I need
      hooks, events, or dynamic behavior. That keeps bundles smaller and avoids sending logic that could run on the
      server.
    </div>

    <h2 id="state-modeling-derived">State modeling and derived state</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I store the minimal source of truth and derive the rest. If the list is filtered or sorted, I keep the raw list
      and the filter/sort inputs; the displayed list is computed (e.g. with useMemo or a selector). That way there's no
      chance of the store and derived view getting out of sync. I'm careful not to duplicate in state what can be
      computed from props or other state.
    </div>

    <h2 id="data-fetching-caching">Data fetching and caching strategies</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I prefer a single strategy per app: React Query, SWR, or server-side in Next.js. I care about loading and error
      states, deduplication, and cache invalidation when data changes. For server-rendered apps I fetch at the route or
      layout level so the page has data before paint. I avoid ad-hoc useEffect fetches in every component; that leads to
      waterfalls and inconsistent caching.
    </div>

    <h2 id="hooks-design">Hooks design and reusability</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I extract hooks when logic is reused or when a component gets hard to follow. A good hook has a clear
      responsibility, a simple API, and returns only what consumers need. I keep side effects and subscriptions inside
      hooks with proper cleanup. I don't over-abstract—if it's used once, it can live in the component until the second
      use case appears.
    </div>

    <h2 id="performance-beyond-component">Performance beyond the component level</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I think in layers: bundle size (code-splitting, tree-shaking, lazy routes), network (caching, prefetching, fewer
      round-trips), and render (virtualization for long lists, memoization where profiling shows benefit). I measure
      before and after; I don't memoize everything by default. Server Components and streaming can remove whole classes
      of client work. I use the React DevTools Profiler when something feels slow and fix the actual bottleneck.

    <h2 id="event-driven-systems">Have you worked with event-driven systems, queues, or workflow orchestrators?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I’ve worked with event-driven systems and queues. They process tasks asynchronously, meaning backend tasks run
      independently of the user’s actions, such as sending welcome emails after signup or processing multi-step
      workflows like payment, inventory checks, and shipment scheduling. On the frontend, I make sure the UI shows
      progress, handles delays or errors
      gracefully, and updates users when events complete, keeping interactions predictable and responsive.
    </div>

    <h2 id="distributed-architectures">Have you worked with distributed architectures (macro-services, microservices, or
      service monoliths) and understand their trade-offs?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      Yes. I’ve worked with monoliths, microservices, and macro-services. Monoliths are simpler to build and deploy but
      scale as a single unit. Microservices enable independent scaling and ownership but add operational and debugging
      complexity. Macro-services balance modularity with lower overhead. I choose the approach based on team size,
      scaling needs, and operational maturity.

    <h2 id="git">Git experience</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I use Git with feature branches, combining related commits into single, meaningful ones (squashing) and updating
      my branch with the latest main changes (rebasing) to keep history clear. Pull requests are for peer review and
      knowledge sharing, with clear names and descriptions so the team can easily understand changes.
    </div>

    <h2 id="optimize-react-large-datasets">How do you optimize React for large datasets?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I optimize React for large datasets by rendering only what's visible and avoiding storing huge lists in global
      state. I fetch or stream data in chunks, and I memoize components so only what actually changes re-renders. This
      keeps the UI fast and responsive even with tens of thousands of items.
    </div>

    <h2 id="api-performance-heavy-load">How do you handle API performance under heavy load?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I handle heavy API load with pagination, caching, and rate limiting to control client requests. Backend queries
      are optimized, batching or joins reduce repeated lookups, and intensive tasks run asynchronously. I monitor
      performance via logs and metrics to spot bottlenecks and add indexes or caching before users are affected.
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">4. Testing, Debugging &amp; Reliability</div>

    <h2 id="testing">Testing strategies</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I use multi-level testing. Jest and React Testing Library cover unit tests for components, hooks, and UI logic.
      Integration tests validate interactions between frontend modules and with APIs. I use Postman to simulate real API
      requests and verify responses. For production issues, I debug data with raw SQL, fix the root cause, and add
      regression tests to ensure existing functionality remains intact. I focus on critical paths and edge cases so
      tests stay efficient and impactful.
    </div>

    <h2 id="debugging-issues">Debugging production issues</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I debug production issues by analyzing logs and monitoring to identify patterns that indicate the error. I trace
      the problem to the specific layer or module, such as a frontend component, backend service, or database query. I
      reproduce it safely, fix the root cause, and add tests or validation to prevent it from recurring.
    </div>

    <h2 id="monitor-production-frontend">How do you monitor production frontend apps?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor frontend apps, tracking logs, errors, and metrics like page load and API
      response times. Alerts notify the team of regressions or anomalies. I focus on critical flows, like logins or form
      submissions, so we catch and fix issues quickly while keeping the app reliable.
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">5. Leadership, Collaboration &amp; Staff Skills</div>

    <h2 id="prioritize-work">
      How do you prioritize work when multiple tasks compete?
    </h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I prioritize tasks by considering how much value they deliver to the business and how time-sensitive they are. I
      first tackle blockers that affect the team, and I communicate early if priorities shift, such as pausing for a
      critical bug, so the team can adjust timelines and stay focused on the most important work.
    </div>

    <h2 id="approach-ambiguous-problems">How do you approach unclear requirements or ambiguous problems?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I clarify goals and constraints, break the problem into smaller parts, and tackle the riskiest areas first. I
      document assumptions, keep stakeholders aligned, and focus on minimal solutions that deliver value and can be
      extended as requirements evolve.
    </div>

    <h2 id="teamwork">How do you work in a team?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I work collaboratively, using code reviews, architecture discussions, and pair programming to share knowledge and
      solve complex problems. I give and receive constructive feedback, stay open to different perspectives, and focus
      on solutions rather than personalities during disagreements. My goal is to help the team stay productive and reach
      consensus without compromising quality.
    </div>

    <h2 id="resolve-team-conflicts">How do you resolve conflicts in the team?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I resolve team conflicts by focusing on the problem, listening to all perspectives, and testing options when
      feasible.
    </div>

    <h2 id="communicate-non-technical">How do you communicate with non-technical teammates or stakeholders?</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I focus on outcomes and trade-offs, not implementation details. I explain options clearly, using simple language
      or sketches, and make decisions collaboratively. Being transparent about risks and priorities builds trust and
      avoids surprises.
    </div>

    <h2 id="customer-facing-experience">
      How do you work with customers or non-internal stakeholders?
    </h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I work directly with customers to understand their goals and constraints, then translate that into clear technical
      decisions. I ask clarifying questions early, explain trade-offs in plain language, and make sure expectations are
      aligned so there are no surprises. I have supported requirements, delivery, and deployments in regulated,
      high-stakes environments, with a strong focus on trust, transparency, and accountability.

    <div class="section-title">6. Consultancy &amp; Client Work</div>

    <h2 id="unfamiliar-codebase">Adapting to unfamiliar client codebases</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I start by understanding the problem domain and how the current code is structured—routes, data flow, and key
      conventions. I read tests and recent PRs to see how the team works. I make small, low-risk changes first and ask
      for review so I learn the norms. I document as I go so the next person benefits. I don't rewrite for the sake of
      it; I improve where I'm working and leave the rest consistent.
    </div>

    <h2 id="quality-vs-timelines">Balancing technical quality with delivery timelines</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I'm explicit about trade-offs: what we're deferring and what risk that creates. I push for the minimum quality bar
      that keeps the system maintainable and operable—tests on critical paths, clear error handling, and no known
      security issues. I'll cut scope or simplify implementation before I ship something that will cost us more later
      without a clear path to fix it. I say when a timeline is unrealistic and propose what's achievable instead.
    </div>

    <h2 id="communicate-tradeoffs">Communicating trade-offs to non-technical stakeholders</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I talk in outcomes and consequences, not implementation. "If we skip this, we risk X and we'll need to do Y later"
      or "Option A is faster to build but harder to change; Option B takes longer now but gives us flexibility." I use
      simple analogies when they help. I make sure they understand the choice and the cost of each path so we can decide
      together instead of me deciding in a vacuum.
    </div>

    <h2 id="pushing-back">Pushing back constructively when requirements are flawed</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      I assume good intent and focus on the goal behind the requirement. I explain the downside of the current ask—e.g.
      "This approach will make it hard to maintain" or "That scope will push the date by X"—and suggest an alternative
      that still gets them what they need. I offer to prototype or spike so we can validate with less commitment. I'm
      not defensive; I'm trying to align on a better outcome. If we still disagree after that, I document the decision
      and move forward.
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">7. Past Failures &amp; Continuous Improvement</div>

    <h2 id="dealing-with-failure">Dealing with failure</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      When a deployment or change causes issues, I take ownership, fix the problem, and improve the process to prevent
      it from happening again. I focus on learning from mistakes and building safeguards for the future.
    </div>

    <h2 id="addressing-technical-weakness">Addressing technical weakness</h2>
    <div class="block quote">
      Early in my career, I tended to over-engineer for future scenarios. I now focus on simple, maintainable solutions
      that solve the current problem while remaining flexible for future changes.
