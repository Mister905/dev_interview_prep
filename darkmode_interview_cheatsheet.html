      <h2 id="intro">Elevator pitch</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I'm a full stack developer with over six years of experience building
        and supporting SaaS products. I own features end to end, from shaping
        requirements and building user-facing interfaces to designing APIs,
        deploying services, and supporting them in production.
      </div>

      <h2 id="why-this-role">Why are you interested in this role?</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I’m excited about this role because it gives me the chance to own
        full-stack features that have real impact. Working on systems that
        detect threats, reduce response times, and help stop crime is genuinely
        motivating. The mix of modern web technology, AI, and clear real-world
        outcomes makes this feel like a great next step for me.
      </div>

      <h2 id="career-path">Why did you choose software development?</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I studied history and political science, but I discovered I really enjoy
        building things. I transitioned into web development through training
        and professional experience.
      </div>

      <h2 id="previous-employers">
        Can you tell me about your previous employers and what kind of work you
        did there?
      </h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        At Civix, I built full-stack software for a SaaS platform helping U.S.
        state agencies manage and dispense FEMA grants following disasters like
        hurricans and floods. At Clearcable, I worked on full-stack systems
        supporting ISP operations, including network monitoring, equipment
        inventory management and internet and phoneservice provisioning.
      </div>

      <h2 id="last-role">Why did you leave your last role?</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I felt my professional growth had plateaued, and then my position was
        eliminated due to budget cuts. Since then, I've been doing freelance
        consulting while looking for new full-stack opportunities.
      </div>

      <h2 id="professional-development">
        What does professional development mean to you?
      </h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I approach professional development by seeking new challenges that push
        me technically, deepening my skills through hands-on work, and learning
        from others via mentorship, code reviews, and architecture discussions.
      </div>

      <h2 id="consulting-work">What consulting work have you done?</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I've been helping a friend explore a business idea by providing
        architecture guidance and prototyping the product using React,
        TypeScript, Node, and SQL.
      </div>

      <h2 id="frontend-exp">Describe your frontend experience</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I have over six years building web applications with React, focusing on
        reusable components, modular architecture, and effective state
        management. I also use Next.js for server-side rendering and routing,
        which allows me to build fast, SEO-friendly pages compared to
        client-only React apps. I prioritize responsive, accessible interfaces
        and use component libraries and utility frameworks to keep designs
        consistent and maintainable.
      </div>

      <h2 id="backend-exp">Describe your backend experience</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I build backends with Node.js, using Express.js for quick APIs and
        NestJS for structured, modular services. I design REST APIs, handle
        auth, validation, and error handling, work with SQL and MongoDB, and
        deploy to AWS/Azure using CI/CD. I enjoy owning features end-to-end,
        balancing scalability and usability.
      </div>

      <h2 id="end-preference">
        Do you prefer frontend or backend development?
      </h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I enjoy full-stack development and don’t have a strong preference. I am
        comfortable working on both frontend and backend and taking ownership of
        features from end to end.
      </div>

      <h2 id="have-you-used-technology">Have you used [technology] before?</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I haven't used Angular or Vue.js professionally yet, but I'm confident
        picking up new frameworks quickly. Vue is similar to React, with Vuex
        for state management and Nuxt.js like Next.js, so my experience with
        component-based, modular architectures transfers easily.
      </div>

      <h2 id="databases-exp">SQL, ORMs, and database experience</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I have solid experience designing relational databases, including
        normalized schemas, indexes, and transactional workflows. I’ve used ORMs
        like Prisma to keep data access consistent and maintainable while still
        being mindful of performance. I’ve also worked with NoSQL databases such
        as MongoDB when a document-based model made more sense for the problem.
      </div>

      <h2 id="ux-ui">UX/UI mindset and examples</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I approach UI and UX with a user-first mindset, building interfaces that
        are intuitive, accessible, and easy to navigate. I focus on things like
        loading skeletons, clear feedback, and proper focus management to make
        apps feel responsive and inclusive. I also use modular component
        libraries to keep the design consistent and scalable.
      </div>

      <h2 id="api-design">How do you design APIs?</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I design APIs following REST principles, with clear endpoints, proper
        HTTP verbs, and meaningful status codes. I focus on well-typed responses
        so frontends integrate cleanly, and I’ve implemented JWT authentication
        and role-based access control. I also build in pagination, filtering,
        and caching from the start to ensure performance scales.
      </div>

      <h2 id="cloud-ci-cd">Cloud deployment & CI/CD experience</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I have experience setting up CI/CD pipelines, automating builds and
        tests on pull requests with tools like GitHub Actions. I configure
        pipelines to fail the deployment if tests don’t pass, giving clear
        feedback in the PR and catching errors before they reach staging or
        production. I deploy frontend and backend services separately through
        repeatable pipelines, configured via environment variables. In
        development, I containerize the frontend, backend, and optionally a
        database using Docker, running them concurrently with Docker Compose.
        This mirrors production conditions locally, allowing me to test
        environment variables, networking, and inter-service communication in a
        safe, isolated setup. I maintain a separate Docker Compose setup to
        closely simulate production, ensuring new features behave as expected
        before deployment. For staging and production, I deploy to AWS or Azure
        using rollback strategies to ensure reliability. Conceptually, I’d use
        ECS or App Service for containers, S3 or Blob storage for static assets,
        and RDS or SQL Database for persistent data, with environment variables
        and secrets stored securely via AWS Secrets Manager or Azure Key Vault.
        Previous container images are tagged and ready for redeployment, so if
        issues arise, I can quickly restore service either in personal projects
        or via CI/CD rollback in production. This approach maintains consistency
        across environments, catches issues early, and ensures smooth,
        predictable releases.
      </div>

      <h2 id="git">Git experience</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I use Git daily for branching, pull requests, code reviews, and
        resolving conflicts. I also keep repositories organized and maintain a
        clean commit history, which helps the team stay aligned and makes
        changes easier to track.
      </div>

      <h2 id="testing">Testing strategies</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I test at multiple levels to ensure reliability. I write unit tests for
        components, utilities, and business logic with Jest, do integration
        testing to verify API and frontend-backend interactions, and use Postman
        to validate APIs in real-world scenarios.
      </div>

      <h2 id="prioritize-work">
        How do you prioritize work when multiple tasks compete?
      </h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I focus on urgency and impact, spot dependencies early, and communicate
        progress proactively to keep the team aligned.
      </div>

      <h2 id="problem-solving-example">
        Complex Full Stack Project Leadership
      </h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        At Civix, I owned an end-to-end document submission and approval feature
        for the New Jersey Office of Emergency Management, supporting FEMA
        compliance workflows. Agencies needed to submit complex documents with
        strict validation, clear approval states, and full auditability. I built
        a modular React frontend for submissions and tracking, backed by SQL
        logic enforcing validation and approval rules. Working closely with QA
        and support, I handled edge cases and refined workflows, balancing
        flexibility, correctness, and usability while keeping the system
        maintainable and scalable.
      </div>

      <h2 id="debugging-issues">Debugging production issues</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I’ve debugged production issues across frontend and backend. When I
        can’t reproduce a bug locally, I gather logs, user reports, and
        environment details, compare staging and production setups, and add
        targeted logging. Sometimes I create a test environment mirroring
        production to isolate the issue. For example, I fixed a Node.js API that
        failed in production due to a misconfigured environment variable and
        corrected a SQL query causing a form not to render. These experiences
        show my ability to solve cross-system problems and work confidently in
        production.”
      </div>

      <h2 id="teamwork">How do you work in a team?</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I work closely with my team through code reviews, architecture
        discussions, and pair programming. I give and take feedback
        thoughtfully, focusing on improving the code, not being right, and
        support teammates with guidance when it’s helpful.
      </div>

      <h2 id="conflict">Handling disagreements</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        When disagreements arise, I listen first, explain my reasoning clearly,
        and focus on solutions rather than personal conflict to keep discussions
        productive.
      </div>

      <h2 id="ai-workflow">How do you use AI in your workflow?</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I use AI to speed up my workflow and maintain quality without replacing
        my judgment. For example, in my Airbnb Tracker project, I use a
        structured AI workflow with Cursor: I start with a project brief,
        generate a technical plan, implement features step by step, and then run
        a code review in a fresh AI context to catch errors and edge cases. This
        helps me stay efficient, consistent, and focused while building complex
        features.
      </div>

      <h2 id="clever-ai-usage">Clever AI Usage / Projects</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
        I built Airbnb Tracker, a full-stack app that tracks changes in Airbnb
        listings over time. It uses a NestJS API, PostgreSQL with Prisma, and a
        Next.js frontend with diff views. I used AI tools to speed up debugging
        and optimization while focusing on building reliable features. The app
        analyzes competing listings by amenities, photo quality, and other
        features to identify patterns, helping hosts improve their listings and
        stay competitive.
      </div>

      <h2 id="interviewer-questions">Questions to ask the Interviewer</h2>
      <div class="block quote">
